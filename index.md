## **[Stuffified Construction](https://github.com/Sixdd6/Stuffified-Construction)**
#### **Not Yet Released**

This is my baby right now. At it's most basic level it sets most things to be constructed by stuff rather than a static cost. This translates into being able to make lamps and smithies and solar panels and all kinds of other things out of any metal you like. Also allows furniture to be made of any type of wood or similar material where appropriate.


Also adds compatibility for [Cupro's Alloys](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=32190.0), [Cupro's Stones](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=32190.0), [Cupro's Quarry](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=32190.0) and adds new matching wood types to [Vegetable Garden](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=12934.0) trees.
